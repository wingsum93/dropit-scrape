# System assumption
Assume user select the desired store and save the cookie, we can fetch products from desired shop

In each type of product, we fetch 96 item each page and fetch until no next page.
System must capture product price even new items is added later. (the limit / number of items is varied)
Assume the name of products is not changed, so the product table is created once we have that product input.
